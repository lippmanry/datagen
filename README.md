# Splunk DataGen

A simple program to generate randomized data for the Splunk HTTP Event Collector

To use this program you must:

2. Set up a HTTP Event Collector in Splunk
3. Set the key in your .env file to the token provided by your HEC
4. Set the host in your .env file to your Splunk instance 

A special thank you to George Starcher for the collector class and example: https://github.com/georgestarcher/Splunk-Class-httpevent
